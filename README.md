## Installation

**Step #1** - Download the Discord bot. After that, configure the **config.js** file according to your preferences. Then, install the necessary modules using **npm install**, and finally run the bot using the command **npm start**.

**Step #2** - Copy the script named **[discordauth]**, into the directory **mods/deathmatch/resources/** within your server files.

**Step #3** - Modify the **config.xml** file located within the copied files according to your preferences.


## Notes

The MySQL credentials in the **config.js** file of the Discord bot should be identical to the credentials in the **config.xml** file of the script.

To run the script, permissions need to be configured. If you're unfamiliar with this topic, you can learn by doing a quick research.
